    "In this experiment, we will use Fourier series and Fourier transforms to analyze continuous-time and descrete-time signals and systems. The Fourier representations of signals involve the decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponential functions. These decompositions are very important in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, due to the property that the response of an LTI system to a complex exponential input is a complex exponential of the same frequency! Only the amplitude and phase of the input signal are changed. Therefore, studying the frequency response of an LTI system gives complete insight into its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment and others to follow, we will use the Simulink extension to Matlab. Simulink is an icon-driven dynamic simulation package that allows the user to represent a system or a process by a block diagram. Once the representation is completed, Simulink may be used to digitally simulate the behavior of the continuous or discrete-time system. Simulink inputs can be Matlab variables from the workspace, or waveforms or sequences generated by Simulink itself. These Simulink-generated inputs can represent continuous- time or discrete-time sources. The behavior of the simulated system can be monitored using Simulink’s version of common lab instruments, such as scopes, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers."
