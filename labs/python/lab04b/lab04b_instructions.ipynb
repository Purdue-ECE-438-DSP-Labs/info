    "In the previous lab (Lab 4a), we saw that the frequency content of a signal must be limited to half the sampling rate in order to avoid aliasing effects in the reconstructed signal. However, reconstruction can be difficult if the sampling rate is chosen to be just above the Nyquist frequency. Reconstruction is much easier for a higher sampling rate because the sampled signal will better “track” the original analog signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "From another perspective, the analog output filter must have a very sharp cutoff in order to accurately reconstruct a signal that was sampled just above the Nyquist rate. Such filters are difficult and expensive to manufacture. Alternatively, a higher sampling rate allows the use analog output filters that have a slow roll-off. These filters are much less expensive. However, a high sampling rate is not practical in most applications, as it resultsin unnecessary samples and excessive storage requirements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A practical solution to this dilemma is to *interpolate* the digital signal to create new (artificial) samples between the existing samples. This may be done by first upsampling the digital representation, and then filtering out unwanted components using a discrete-time filter. This discrete-time filter serves the same purpose as an analog filter with a sharp cutoff, but it is generally simpler and more cost effective to implement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upsampling a signal by a factor of $L$ is simply the process of inserting $L − 1$ zeros in between each sample. The frequency domain relationship between a signal $x(n)$ and its upsampled version $z(n)$ can be shown to be the following\n",

    "    Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega L).\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}   \n",

    "Therefore the DTFT of $z(n)$ is simply $X(\\omega)$ compressed in frequency by a factor of $L$. Since $X(\\omega)$ has a period of $2\\pi$, $Z(\\omega)$ will have a period of $2\\pi/L$. All of the original information of $x(n)$ will be contained in the interval $[−\\pi/L, \\pi/L]$ of $Z(\\omega)$, and the new aliases that are created in the interval $[−\\pi, \\pi]$ are the unwanted components that need to be filtered out. In the time domain, this filtering has the effect of changing the inserted zeros into artificial samples of $x(n)$, commonly known as *interpolated* samples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Figure 1 shows a Simulink model that demonstrates discrete-time interpolation. The interpolating system contains three main components: an upsampler which inserts $L − 1$ zeros between each input sample, a discrete-time low pass filter which removes aliased signal components in the interpolated signal, and a gain block to correct the magnitude of the final signal. Notice that __signal a__ is the input discrete-time signal while __signal c__ is the final interpolated discrete-time signal.\n",

    "Simulink represents any discrete-time signal by holding each sample value over a certain time period. This representation is equivalent to a sample-and-hold reconstruction of the underlying discrete-time signal. Therefore, a continuous-time __*Spectrum Analyzer*__ may be used to view the frequency content of the output __signal c__. The __*Zero-Order Hold*__ at the __*Gain*__ output is required as a buffer for the __*Spectrum Analyzer*__ in order to set its internal sampling period.\n",
