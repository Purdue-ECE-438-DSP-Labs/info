    "In digital signal processing applications, it is often necessary to change the relative amplitudes of frequency components or remove undesired frequencies of a signal. This process is called **filtering**. Digital filters are used in a variety of applications. In Lab 4, we saw that digital filters may be used in systems that perform interpolation and decimation on discrete-time signals. Digital filters are also used in audio systems that allow the listener to adjust the bass (low-frequency energy) and the treble (high frequency energy) of audio signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital filter design requires the use of both frequency domain and time domain techniques.  This is because filter design specifications are often given in the frequency domain, but filters are usually implemented in the time domain with a difference equation. Typically, frequency domain analysis is done using the Z-transform and the discrete-time Fourier Transform (DTFT).\n",
