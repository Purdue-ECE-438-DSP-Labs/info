    "We have seen in the preceding sections that the DFT is a very computationally intensive operation. In 1965, Cooley and Tukey [1] published an algorithm that could be used to compute the DFT much more efficiently. Various forms of their algorithm, which came to be known as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), had actually been developed much earlier by other mathematicians (even dating back to Gauss). It was their paper, however, which stimulated a revolution in the field of signal processing.\n",

    "It is important to keep in mind at the outset that the FFT is **NOT** a new transform. It is simply a very efficient way to compute an existing transform, namely the DFT. As we saw, a straight forward implementation of the DFT can be computationally expensive because the number of multiplies grows as the square of the input length (i.e. $N^2$ for an $N$ point DFT). The FFT reduces this computation using two simple but important concepts. The first concept, known as **divide-and-conquer**, splits the problem into two smaller problems. The second concept, known as **recursion**, applies this divide-and-conquer method repeatedly until the problem is solved.\n",

The only difference between them is the length of the input signal, and the function called to compute the ($N/2$)-pt DFTs. Obviously, it’s redundant to write a separate function for each specific length DFT when they each have the same form. The preferred method is to write a **recursive** function, which means that the function calls itself within the body. It is imperative that a recursive function has a condition for exiting without calling itself, otherwise it would never terminate."
