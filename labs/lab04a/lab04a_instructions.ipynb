    "It is often desired to analyze and process continuous-time signals using a computer. However, in order to process a continuous-time signal, it must first be digitized. This means that the continuous-time signal must be sampled and quantized, forming a digital signal that can be stored in a computer. Analog systems can be converted to their discrete-time counterparts, and these digital systems then process discrete-time signals to produce discrete-time outputs. The digital output can then be converted back to an analog signal, or *reconstructed*, through a digital-to-analog converter. Figure 1 illustrates an example, containing the three general components described above: a sampling system, a digital signal processor, and a reconstruction system.\n",

    "Sampling is simply the process of measuring the value of a continuous-time signal at certain instants of time. Typically, these measurements are uniformly separated by the sampling period, $T_s$. If $x(t)$ is the input signal, then the sampled signal, $y[n]$, is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y[n]=x(t)|_{t=nT_s}.\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical question is the following: What sampling period, $T_s$, is required to accurately represent the signal $x(t)$? To answer this question, we need to look at the frequency domain representations of $y[n]$ and $x(t)$. Since $y[n]$ is a discrete-time signal, we represent its frequency content with the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), $Y(e^{j\\omega})$. However, $x(t)$ is a continuous-time signal, requiring the use of the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT), denoted as $X(f)$. Fortunately, $Y(\\omega)$ can be written in terms of $X(f)$:\n",

    "Consistent with the properties of the DTFT, $Y(\\omega)$ is periodic with a period $2\\pi$. It is formed by rescaling the amplitude and frequency of $X(f)$, and then repeating it in frequency every $2\\pi$. The critical issue of the relationship in (1) is the frequency content of $X(f)$. If $X(f)$ has frequency components that are above $1/(2T_s)$, the repetition in frequency will cause these components to overlap with (i.e. add to) the components below $1/(2T_s)$. This causes an unrecoverable distortion, known as *aliasing*, that will prevent a perfect reconstruction of $X(f)$. We will illustrate this later in the lab. The $1/(2T_s)$ \"cutoff frequency\" is known as the **_Nyquist frequency_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent aliasing, most sampling systems first low pass filter the incoming signal to ensure that its frequency content is below the Nyquist frequency. In this case, $Y(\\omega)$ can be related to $X(f)$ through the $k=0$ term in (1):\n",

Also, note that $\\omega=\\pi$ in $Y(e^{j\\omega})$ corresponds to the Nyquist frequency, $f=1/(2T_s)$ in $X(f)$.\n",

Theoretically, this can be done by converting the discrete-time signal to a sequence of continuous-time impulses that are weighted by the sample values.

These devices work by reading the current sample, and generating a corresponding output voltage for a period of $T_s$ seconds. The combined effect of sampling and D/A conversion may be thought of as a single sample-and-hold device. Unfortunately, the sample-and-hold process distorts the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed signal. In this section, we will analyze the effects of using a $\\text{zero}^{\\text{th}}$-order sample-and-hold in a sampling and reconstruction system. Later in the laboratory, we will see how the distortion introduced by a sample-and-hold process may be reduced through the use of discrete-time interpolation.\n",

If there were no sampling, this system would simply be two analog filters in cascade. We know the frequency response for this simpler system. Any differences between this and the frequency response for the entire system is a result of the sampling and reconstruction. Our goal is to compare the two frequency responses using Python. For this analysis, we will assume that the filters are $N^{\\text{th}}$ order Butterworth filters with a cutoff frequency of $f_c$ , and that the sample-and-hold runs at a sampling rate of $f_s = 1/T_s$.\n",
